// Create a prompt for user to enter froyo flavors 

// Parse user input into an array of froyo flavors 

// Build an object to track which flavors you've observed

// Create a loop to iterate through the array of flavors 

// Build an object to keep count of how many orders there are of each flavor

// Ensure the program correctly counts the # of each flavor in user's input

// Console output changes depending on the user's input
